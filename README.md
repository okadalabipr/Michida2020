# Michida et al., 2020

## Introduction

This repository contains source codes used in our paper, Michida et al., 2020. This paper is in press, thus details will be updated after publication.

These source codes were used to perform integrative sequence analysis.

We hope our these source codes contribute your work about enhancers regulation, chromatin dynamics and so on.

## Usage  

Please refer to the table below for the source code needed for reproduction of figures. To run the source codes, it is required to run the dependencies available on the files dependency map.

Sequence data is available from DDBJ: DRA009412 (ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq of RelA and H3K27Ac and single-cell RNA-seq.) and DRA009931 (single-cell ATAC-seq) after the publication.
